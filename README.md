# KhLunarApi

This project is created to fullfill my portfolio on Asp.Net + Vue.js.

Khmer lunar calendar (Khmer lunisolar calendar, to be precise) exists in various applications for mobile (iOS and Android).
However, there are only a few applications for computer, especially, for macOS and Linux.

On Windows, I have used ANT Pedia, which was developed in 2016 (http://www.antkh.com/tech/2212 - web page in Khmer). 
This application was an upgrade from ANT Dictionary 2011-2012.

Later, I found a website for Khmer lunar calendar, cam-cc.org. Unfortunately, this website had been taken down.
Khmer (lunar) calendar is a part of tovnah project (http://dictionary.tovnah.com/), I presume.
Therefore, Khmer (lunar) calendar still can access with this link (https://khmer-calendar.tovnah.com/calendar).

As I tried to understand algorithm of Khmer lunar calendar, I found several sources. Luckily, one project developed
Khmer lunar calendar in C# language (.Net project). Here is his Github repository: https://github.com/nhoemchenda/.net-khmer-lunar

This is an API project, therefore, documentation can be found in {baseUrl}/swagger/index.html
